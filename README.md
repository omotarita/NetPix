## NetPix

My app, NetPix, intends to offer a solution to streaming site users who suffer from “decision fatigue”: that is a phenomenon describing users’ struggle to choose, which is exacerbated by having more options they have to choose from. What’s the point in having thousands of content options on sites like Netflix and Amazon Prime if that makes it even harder to choose one?

## Notes

I have included in [store](netpix_app/store.html) file, a file in which I would store many rough lines of code which were later adapted and subsequently integrated into the scripts that formed to my Flask app. Please note that this file is just a store and should not be considered as a part of my final Flask app submission. 

Please use the followin command to run this app:
python3 netpix_app/app.py
